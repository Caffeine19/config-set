# Config-Set: Personal Development Environment Configuration 🛠️

This repository manages a comprehensive collection of configuration files for a macOS development environment. Each directory contains configurations for specific tools, with automated linking and build systems.

## Architecture Overview 🏗️

**Configuration Management Pattern**: Each tool directory contains:

- Raw configuration files (dotfiles, JSON, YAML, Lua scripts)
- `link.sh` scripts for symlinking configs to proper system locations
- Custom build systems for tools requiring compilation/processing

**Key Tool Categories**:

- **Terminal/Shell** 🐚: Zsh (Oh My Zsh), Warp terminal with launch configurations
- **Window Management** 🪟: yabai + skhd + Hammerspoon for advanced macOS window control
- **Development Tools** 💻: VS Code (modular settings), Neovim, Karabiner Elements
- **Theming** 🎨: Extensive theme collections (Warp, VSCode token customizations)

## Critical Workflows ⚡

### VSCode Settings Management 📝

The `VSCode/settingsDotJson/` directory uses a **modular JSON merge system**:

```bash
cd VSCode/settingsDotJson && pnpm run build
```

- Source modules in `src/modules/*.json` are merged via TypeScript
- Build creates timestamped `build/settings.json` with automatic versioning
- Uses `comment-json` library to preserve comments in JSON

### Configuration Linking 🔗

Each tool has its own `link.sh` script that creates symlinks:

```bash
# Example pattern for any tool
cd <tool-directory> && ./link.sh
```

- Handles existing links gracefully (checks before creating)
- Links to standard config locations (`~/.config/`, `~/.hammerspoon/`, etc.)

### Warp Launch Configurations 🚀

Project-specific workspace setups in `Warp/launch_configurations/`:

- Each YAML defines terminal layouts with specific directories and split panes
- Used for quickly launching development environments for different projects
- Contains real project paths (binjiang, yq-common, pbis, etc.)

## Project-Specific Conventions 🔧

### Multi-Machine Support 💻

Zsh configurations have machine-specific variants:

- `Zsh/Mac/MacBookProM2Max/` vs `Zsh/Mac/MacBookAirM3/`
- Different plugin sets and performance optimizations per machine

### Karabiner Complex Modifications ⌨️

JSON files in `KarabinerElements/` define advanced key mappings:

- **Double Command To Hyper M**: Complex timing-based key detection
- **Caps Lock transformations**: Context-aware modifier key behavior
- Uses Karabiner's variable system for stateful key handling

### Hammerspoon Integration 🔨

Lua scripts in `Hammerspoon/src/` provide:

- Window management functions exposed to Apple Shortcuts via `_G` globals
- Integration with Raycast for automation triggers
- Edge browser tab management via accessibility APIs

### Window Management Stack 🎛️

**yabai** (window manager) + **skhd** (hotkeys) + **Hammerspoon** (advanced scripting):

- yabai configured for stack layout with specific padding/gaps
- skhd provides alt+hjkl navigation and alt+shift+hjkl swapping
- Hammerspoon handles complex window operations not possible in yabai

## Key Files to Reference 📁

- `VSCode/settingsDotJson/src/merge.ts` - JSON module merge logic
- `Hammerspoon/src/init.lua` - Global function exports for system integration
- `yabai/yabairc` + `skhd/skhdrc` - Window management configuration pair
- `Zsh/module/link.sh` - Oh My Zsh custom module linking pattern
- `Warp/launch_configurations/*.yaml` - Project workspace templates

## Development Notes 📝

- **TypeScript builds** use `tsx` for direct TS execution without compilation
- **Symlink management** is idempotent - safe to re-run link scripts
- **Theme management** follows base16 architecture for color consistency
- **Cross-tool integration** via shell exports, global functions, and shared keybindings
